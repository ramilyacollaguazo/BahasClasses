1. What is the purpose on using if statements?

-if statement is control flow
-to put a condition
-conditional statement
-it works with boolean expression or the expression should hae boolean outcome
-if statements can be implemented/used without else statement

we also have else statements:
-which gets executed when if statements is false
-else statement cannot be without if

2. Write a logic /code for thermostat?

//it's set on automatic which turns on the heater or AC
//depending on the current temp in your house
//if it's above desired temp then turnOnAc()
//else turnOnHeat() [if it's colder than desired temp]

ex: int currentTemp =60;
    int desiredTemp =72;

    if(currentTemp<= desiredTemp){
        System.out.println("Turn on the heater!");
    }else {
       System.out.println("Turn on the AC!");
        }
  ================ ============== ============== ==============
3. Convert the above if else to ternary operator:

Ex: int currentTemp =60;
    int desiredTemp =72;

        String heaterOrAc =currentTemp <=desiredTemp? "Turn on the heater!":"Turn on the AC!"

4. Constant variables in java? what are they?

-their values cannot be changed or reassigned;
-final keyword is used when initializing it;
-naming is all caps;  ex: final static String DOB

5. Different types of typecasting
2 types:
 --implicit and explicit
 -implicit [automatic] -->data type conversion happens automatically [ex: smaller data type to larger data type]
--explicit [manually]--> has to be manually type casted form larger to smaller [ex:from double to int]

6. Help me to create a class called "MyClass" and it's not in the default package so the package name is "my_package":

package my_package;
public class MyClass{

    public static void main(String [] args){
    System.out.println( "DevX");
    }
}
7. Get an input from the user about their age, Name, last name, favorite quote?

ex: Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);//created an object of Scanner class
//that way we can have access to the methods by typing the objects name and import the methods
//the methods such as: nextInt(), nextBoolean(), nextLine()etc.
